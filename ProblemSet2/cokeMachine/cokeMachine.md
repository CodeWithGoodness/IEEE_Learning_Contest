The code sets the initial value of 'paid_amount' to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as paid amount is less than 50.

Inside the while loop, it first prints the amount due, which is calculated as the difference between 50 and the current paid_amount and displays this using 'print'.

The code then prompts the user to insert a coin using the input() function. The input is stored in the variable 'payment'.

Next, the code adds the value of the 'payment' to the 'paid_amount' using. The int(payment) converts the user input from a string to an integer before adding it to 'paid_amount'.

The while loop continues to iterate until the 'paid_amount' becomes 50 or more.

After exiting the while loop, the code proceeds to calculate the change owed by subtracting 50 from the final paid_amount and prints it.
