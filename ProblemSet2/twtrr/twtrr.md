The code prompts the user to enter some text using the input() function and assigns the input to the variable input_text.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates over each character (i) in the input_text.

Inside the loop, it checks if the lowercase version of the current character (i.lower()) is not equal to any of the vowels "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u". This is done using a series of logical comparisons with the != operator.
If the current character is not a vowel, it is printed using print(i, end=""). The end="" argument is used to prevent the print() function from adding a newline character after each character is printed, ensuring that the characters are printed on the same line.
The code effectively filters out and prints only the non-vowel characters from the user's input.
