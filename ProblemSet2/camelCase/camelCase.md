#### CamelCase
The 'main' function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a string in CamelCase format, assigns the input to the variable 'in_camel_case', and then calls the 'to_snake_case' function with the input as an argument. The resulting snake_case string is printed.
The 'to_snake_case' function takes a string (word) as input, representing a string in CamelCase format. It iterates over each character of the input string using a for loop.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current character (word[i]) is uppercase using the isupper() method. If it is, it adds an underscore (_) before the lowercase version of the character using the lower() method.
If the character is not uppercase, it simply prints the character as it is.
The resulting snake_case string is printed character by character, without spaces or newlines.
The code concludes by calling the main function, which initiates the program. It prompts the user for input, converts the input from CamelCase to snake_case and prints the resulting snake_case string.
