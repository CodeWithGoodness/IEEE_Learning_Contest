It has the following functions: 
#### dollars_to_float(d)

This function takes a string representing a dollar amount as input and converts it to a float value. It performs the following steps:

1. It removes the dollar sign using the replace() method.
2. The resulting string is converted to a float using the float() function and stored in a variable called "floatValue".
3. 'floatValue' is rounded to one decimal place using f-string formatting and stored in the variable to_1_dp.
3. The function returns the 'floatValue' to_1_dp.

#### percent_to_float(p)

This function takes a string representing a percentage as input and converts it to a float value. It follows these steps:

1. It removes the percentage sign using the replace() method.

2. The resulting string is converted to a float by dividing it by 100 using the '/' operator and then stored in a variable, 'toFloat'.

3. The function returns the resulting float value of the 'toFloat' variable.

#### main()

The main() function serves as the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:

1. It prompts the user to input the cost of the meal using the input() function and then calls the dollars_to_float() function and passes the value of the user input as an argument to convert it to a float which is then stored in a variable - 'dollars'

2. It prompts the user to input the desired tip percentage using the input() function. The tip percentage is passed to the percent_to_float() function to convert it to a float. The result is stored in a variable called "percent"

3. The tip amount is calculated by multiplying 'dollars' and 'percent'.

4. The tip amount is printed using f-string formatting to display it with two decimal places.

Finally, the main() function is called at the end of the code to execute the program and calculate the tip amount based on user input.
