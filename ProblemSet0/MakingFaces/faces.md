##FACES

This program has 2 major functions: main() and convert().
#### convert()
This function takes in a string parameter and uses the string.replace() function to convert any emoticon[:) and :(]
within the string to emoji [üôÇ and üôÅ]. The converted string is now stored in a new variable called 'new'. The return keyword returns the value of 'new'
to the convert() function.
           
#### main()
Prompts the user for input and stores it in the variable, "userInput". It then calls the convert function which checks for emoticons and converts to emojis. The result of this is stored in a variable called, "convertedInput" which is then printed.
Thus, execution begins from line 14 to line 1-2,  then to line 9-11 and back to line 4
