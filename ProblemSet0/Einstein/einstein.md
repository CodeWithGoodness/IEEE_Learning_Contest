used 3 variables to solve this problem(c, m, E)
c which is a constant is assigned a value of 300000000 in the first line.
In line 3, the user is prompted to input the value of the mass, this is stored in the variable -m. The user input is a string, hence it is type-casted 
to the integer type using "int()".
Next, calculate the value of the energy using the given formula (E = mc^2). I used double asterisk to raise c to power 2.
Lastly, print the result. Used "" to print strings(words), without "" for variables and seperating both with a comma .
