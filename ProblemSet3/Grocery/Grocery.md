#### Grocery

This code starts by initializing an empty dictionary called 'grocery_list' to store the grocery items and their quantities.

The program enters a try block, and within it, there is an infinite loop using 'while True'.

Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter a grocery item using the input() function. The input is stored in the 'grocery_item' variable.

If the grocery_item is not already in the grocery_list dictionary, it means it's a new item. In this case, the code adds the item to the dictionary as a key and sets its initial quantity to 1.

If the grocery_item already exists in the grocery_list dictionary, the code increments its quantity by 1.

The loop continues indefinitely until an EOFError is raised, which typically occurs when the user signals the end of input (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+D on Unix/Linux systems or Ctrl+Z on Windows).

Once the loop is terminated by the EOFError, the code enters another block.

It iterates over the items in the 'grocery_list' dictionary using a 'for loop'.

The items are sorted using the 'sorted()' function, which returns a new list of items in sorted order based on the keys.

Inside the loop, each item's key (the grocery item) is stored in the variable 'list_name', and the corresponding value (the quantity) is stored in the variable 'count'.

The code then prints the grocery item and its quantity in uppercase using the 'print()' function.
