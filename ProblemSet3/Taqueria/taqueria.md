The code initializes a variable 'total' to 0 to keep track of the total cost of the ordered items.

The program enters an infinite loop using 'while True'.

Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter a menu item using the input() function. The input is stored in the 'user_input' variable and converted to title case using the title() method.

A dictionary called 'menu' is defined, which maps menu item names to their respective prices.

The code then iterates over the keys of the menu dictionary using a for loop. For each key, it checks if it matches the 'user_input'.

If a match is found, the corresponding menu item's price is added to the total variable using the += operator, and the current total is printed with two decimal places using the print() function and formatted string (f"{total:.2f}").

If an EOFError exception occurs (typically when the user signals the end of input, such as by pressing Ctrl+D on Unix/Linux systems or Ctrl+Z on Windows), the loop is terminated using the break statement.

In summary, this code allows the user to input menu items, calculates the total cost based on the selected items, and continuously updates and prints the total. The loop continues until an EOFError is encountered.
