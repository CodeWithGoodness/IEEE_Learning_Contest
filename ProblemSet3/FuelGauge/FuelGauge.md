#### FuelGauge

This code defines a 'main' function and two helper functions, 'level' and 'fraction_to_percent'.

 Here's an explanation of the code:
 #### The main function
This an infinite loop using 'while True'. It repeatedly prompts the user to enter a fraction value for the fuel gauge using the input() function.

Inside the loop, the user's input is stored in the 'fuel_gauge' variable.
The code then calls the 'fraction_to_percent' function with 'fuel_gauge' as an argument to convert the fraction to a percentage.
If the converted percentage value is not equal to the string "0", it calls the level function to determine the fuel level based on the percentage value.
Any ValueError or ZeroDivisionError exceptions that occur during the execution of the code inside the loop are caught using except blocks. The pass statement is used to silently ignore these exceptions and continue to the next iteration of the loop.

#### Level function:
The level function takes a parameter 'p' which represents the fuel level as a percentage.

It checks the value of p and prints "F" if p is greater than or equal to 99, indicating a full fuel tank.
It prints "E" if p is less than or equal to 1, indicating an empty fuel tank.
Otherwise, it prints the value of p followed by the "%" symbol.

#### Fraction_to_percent function:
The fraction_to_percent function takes a fraction string 'f' as input.

It splits the fraction string using the "/" delimiter and assigns the numerator and denominator to variables numerator and denominator, respectively.
It then checks if the denominator is greater than or equal to the numerator. If it is, it calculates the percentage value by dividing the numerator by the denominator and multiplying by 100.
The resulting percentage value is returned as an integer.
If the denominator is not greater than or equal to the numerator, it returns the string "0".
The main function is called at the end of the code, which starts the execution of the program.

In summary, this program continuously prompts the user to enter a fuel gauge fraction, converts it to a percentage using fraction_to_percent, and determines the fuel level using level. The fuel level is then printed based on certain conditions.
