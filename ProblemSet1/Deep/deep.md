### Deep Thought
This code prompts the user to input their answer to the great question of life, the universe, and everything. It then checks the user's answer and provides a response based on the input. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The user is prompted to enter their answer to the question using the input() function. The message "What is the answer to the great question of life, the universe, and everything?" is displayed to the user.

The lower() function is used to convert the user's input to lowercase, ensuring that the code can handle different casing variations.

The strip() function is applied to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, ensuring that the comparison works correctly and the resulting string stored in a variable called 'answer'.

The code compares the user's answer(answer) using an if statement:

a. If the answer matches "42", "forty-two", or "forty two" (ignoring case and leading/trailing whitespace), the condition answer == "42" or answer == "forty-two" or answer == "forty two" evaluates to True. In this case, the code executes the corresponding block and prints "Yes".

b. If the answer does not match any of the above conditions, meaning the user's answer is not "42", "forty-two", or "forty two", the code executes the else block and prints 'No'.

The purpose of this code is to check if the user's answer matches the widely known answer of "42" to the great question of life, the universe, and everything, as famously described in Douglas Adams' science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." If the user's answer matches, the code responds with "Yes"; otherwise, it provides an alternative message.
